# cloud-project

#Introduction
This project is a cloud-based C# application that serves as both a task master and a task worker. The master component is responsible for managing tasks, distributing them to workers, and aggregating results. The worker component performs the actual processing of tasks, reporting back to the master upon completion.

The application is designed to be scalable and efficient, capable of handling a large volume of tasks distributed across multiple workers.

#Features
Task Management: The master node manages and queues tasks for execution.
Task Distribution: Tasks are distributed to available worker nodes.
Scalability: Easily scale the number of worker nodes based on the load.
Fault Tolerance: Built-in mechanisms for handling worker failures and retrying tasks.
Cloud Deployment: Designed to run on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).

#Architecture
The application follows a master-worker architecture:
##Master Node:
Manages the task queue.
Distributes tasks to workers.
Aggregates and processes results.
Handles worker failures and task retries.
##Worker Node:
Fetches tasks from the master.
Executes the task.
Reports the result back to the master.

#Getting Started
Prerequisites:
.NET SDK
A cloud account (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
